# VayGo-App
The Code Repository for the VayGo Travel App

This is the code repository for my first "ambitious" app idea. The VayGo travel app, is in all in one group travling app. 
Users will be able to plan, manage, and track their group vaction all in one area. Allowing them to stress less and party more. 

🚀 Key Features That Will Make It Stand Out 🚀
(Because by all means this idea is not that original. But I do believe with my "social" approach. Making it less like expedia and more like snapchat. Users will enjoy it more.)

📊  1. “Vibe Check” Voting System
User will come together and vote on important things for the trip 
- location,
-  date
-  Airbnb/ Hotel
-  car rental
-  activities, etc...

*Might Incorporate emojis for a "fun" play*
(Ex. Easy vote: 🔥 = love it, 🤷‍♂️ = fine, 💀 = no)
(Transparent voting will show how aligned everyone is and allow them to adjust for the trip based on these types of results.)

🧾 2. Auto Split & Accountability Ledger
- Users can choose what they're pitchig in on and it'll show how much everyone has chipped in
- Users will be able to add things that need to be paid for, and then the group will be able to click on it and add themsleves to the bill or basically choose waht they wanna chip in on.
- Soft reminders to users so their friends don't have to pester them and ruin the trip or vibe. 
(Syncs with Venmo, Zelle, or Apple Pay)

📆 3. Smart Timeline Builder
- Build a trip itenerary so everyone knows the trip details and don't have to be reminded
- App could also give reminders to start getting ready or reminders about reservations and plans. 
(Each event shows who RSVP’d, who’s driving, cost estimate, and map links/ location)

Real-time updates when things change (e.g., “Dinner moved to 8:30”)

📍 4. “Where’s Everyone?” Mode
Optional real-time location sharing (toggleable for privacy)

View a heatmap or list of who’s where

Useful during airport chaos or late-night outings

📸 7. Shared Memory Vault
Upload photos from the trip

Everyone can tag moments, add voice notes

At the end, app auto-generates a “Trip Rewind” video collage
