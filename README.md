# VayGo-App
The Code Repository for the VayGo Travel App

This is the code repository for my first "ambitious" app idea. The VayGo travel app, is in all in one group travling app. 
Users will be able to plan, manage, and track their group vaction all in one area. Allowing them to stress less and party more. 

🚀 Key Features That Will Make It Stand Out 🚀
(Because by all means this idea is not that original. But I do believe with my "social" approach. Making it less like expedia and more like snapchat. Users will enjoy it more.)

<strong> 📊  1. “Vibe Check” Voting System </strong>
User will come together and vote on important things for the trip 
- location,
-  date
-  Airbnb/ Hotel
-  car rental
-  activities, etc...

*Might Incorporate emojis for a "fun" play*
(Ex. vote: 🔥 = love it, 🤷‍♂️ = fine, 💀 = no)

(Transparent voting will show how aligned everyone is and allow them to adjust for the trip based on these types of results.)


<strong> 🧾 2. Auto Split & Accountability Ledger </strong>
- Users can choose what they're pitchig in on and it'll show how much everyone has chipped in
- Users will be able to add things that need to be paid for, and then the group will be able to click on it and add themsleves to the bill or basically choose waht they wanna chip in on.
- Soft reminders to users so their friends don't have to pester them and ruin the trip or vibe. 
(Syncs with Venmo, Zelle, or Apple Pay)

<strong> 📆 3. Trip Builder/ Itenerary </strong>
- Build a trip itenerary so everyone knows the trip details and don't have to be reminded
- App could also give reminders to start getting ready or reminders about reservations and plans. 
(Each event shows who RSVP’d, who’s driving, cost estimate, and map links/ location)
- Real-time updates when things change (e.g., “Dinner moved to 8:30”)

<strong> 📍 4. Live Location Sharing </strong>
- Share live location with the entire group on a live map
- Share status if you arent with the group (Busy, napping, eating, exploring, etc.) 
(Useful during airport chaos or late-night outings/ safety)

<strong> 📢 5. Trip Group Chat w/ Auto Threads </strong> 
- Group chat to talk and plan trip
- Thread to show pics and stuff on trip
- Ai sumnmarizer for those who missed a lot in the chat


<strong> 📸 7. Shared Memory Vault (Social Groups) </strong>
- Other groups can leave reviews on trips they've taken
- Can share their group pics and memories for others to see
- Trip Reviews by Groups, Not Just Individuals
(Ex. “Squad of 6 from Boston rated this cabin 9.3/10 – ‘Great views, but bring bug spray. Josh got destroyed.”)
- Hot Spots Map Layer
(Tap a city or area and see “Group Tags” — favorite spots, secret finds, sketchy places to avoid.)

🧳 8. PackTogether List
Collaborative packing checklist — assigns items (e.g., “Speaker – Jessie 🎵”)

Alert when someone forgot to pack what they committed to (“Ayo… no one brought sunscreen 😐”)

🎁 9. “Deal Hunt” Bot
AI bot that finds deals for flights, stays, or activities — based on your trip window & budget

Notifies the group when it finds something spicy

💬 10. Roast or Toast
Optional feature: after the trip, everyone anonymously sends praise or playful roasts

“Best Dressed 💅” – “Most Likely to Miss a Flight 🫠” – “Car DJ MVP 🎧”
