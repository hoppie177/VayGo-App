<strong> 1. Core Features & MVP (Minimum Viable Product) 
We’ll want to focus on the most essential features to get the app up and running. Here’s a starting point:

<strong> User Accounts/Profiles: </strong>
Allow users to: 
- create and manage profiles.
- adding friends and forming groups.

Group Planning:

Create trips with group invites.

Collaborative itinerary building (add places, activities, travel times).

Group voting or polls for decisions (where to eat, what to do, etc.).

Real-Time Location Sharing:
Share your location with group members during the trip.

Trip Chats & Updates:
In-app messaging for group discussions, reminders, and updates.

AI Trip Suggestions:
Based on the location, weather, and group preferences, suggest activities, restaurants, etc.

<strong> 2. Design & UI/UX </strong>
App Design Style:
Clean, modern, and easy to use. A minimalistic but fun look with a focus on vibrant colors to make it feel fresh.

Wireframes/Prototypes:
I recommend designing screens for the following:

Home/Trip Dashboard: Shows all your current and upcoming trips.

Create Trip Screen: Where users can create new trips, add friends, set dates, and more.

Trip Details Screen: Where users can collaborate on the itinerary, vote on activities, and track updates.

Chat/Notifications: Group chat interface for real-time conversations and notifications.

<strong> 3. Tech Stack
Backend:

You can use Node.js with Express for server-side logic.

A database like MongoDB (for scalable data storage) or Firebase (if you want to handle real-time features and user authentication easily).

Frontend (Mobile App):

If you’re building for iOS, Swift would be a solid choice.

For Android, Kotlin is ideal.

You could also use Flutter (if you want to target both iOS and Android simultaneously) — as you’ve mentioned interest in Flutter development before.

Location & Maps Integration:

Use Google Maps API for location tracking and activity suggestions based on the user’s location.

AI Recommendations:

Use simple AI or recommendation systems based on pre-built libraries or services, such as TensorFlow Lite (for mobile apps) or OpenAI API for personalized trip suggestions.

<strong> 4. Next Steps
Develop Wireframes:
Start with basic wireframes for the app to visualize the user flow and interface.

Build Out the Backend:
Set up the server, database, and user authentication system. You can use Firebase Authentication for quick user sign-in or custom JWT-based authentication.

Develop Core Features:
Start by building out the trip creation and management features, then gradually implement location sharing, AI suggestions, and real-time messaging.
